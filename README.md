# Advent of Code

## How I Get the Puzzles

Using `aocdl` utility to download puzzle inputs.  Requires Go if grabbing with `go get`.  Pre-compiled binary will also work if you download/compile and put in path.

```bash
go get github.com/GreenLightning/advent-of-code-downloader/aocdl

aocdl -session-cookie 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 -year 2015 -day 1
```

## Note on the Code

Some of this is so I can learn a new language, _namely Go_.

In the case of the PowerShell this is very much quick and dirty solutions.  Things like tests, error checking, parameterization, and modularizing are minimal to non-existent.  Quick and dirty solves the puzzle, channeling some inner Battle Faction for this üòÅ!
